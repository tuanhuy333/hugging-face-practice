C++ is another language that is based on OOP principles. It provides features such as classes and objects, and it allows for low-level memory manipulation. However, the complexity of C++ can be a drawback for some developers.

JavaScript, though primarily known for web development, also supports object-oriented programming. It allows developers to create reusable code through prototypes and classes. Modern JavaScript (ES6 and beyond) has adopted many OOP features, making it a versatile language for both front-end and back-end development.

In summary, Java is a robust and versatile language ideal for enterprise-level applications. It emphasizes OOP principles, ensuring that software is modular, maintainable, and scalable. While languages like Python and C++ offer their own advantages, Java remains a popular choice for developers around the world.
